1: So we converted the json  that contains all the data for library. The converted the file to xml first then created the DTD file for it.
2: After the validation of DTD fle we created the XSD that we created the XSD file for the converted XML file.
3:While working on xml file and creating the DTD file the major problem I faced was while accessing each and every element of the xml that I had converted.Then I dicuss with my partner and we look for each element and then wrote the DTD for it.
4:After the DTD our task was to create the XSD file which was made by my partner where we look for all the (complextype and elements) and then my partner created the XSD file.
5:Our next task was the XSL file which was made by me.Where I started with the Title then created the table to display it in table format and moved on to access each element by for-each for which I gave the path to the xml root tag and then continued with the displaying all the data.I added all the data in table data HTML tag(td) and all the Headings such as Id,Name,Address etc in table heading Tag(th)
6:In this manner I had contributed for doing the XML,DTD and XSL file in the library Project
